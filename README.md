## One Cool Thing...
this application reaches into the DOM to get the height of the images, so the grid span can be fitted accordingly

## Technologies

This react application uses axios to make api calls to the unsplash api and brings back a set of images. Once it gets the images back, it uses CSS display grid to layout the images in a grid format.  To make the format responsive to images of any size, it uses the react ref system to get the height of the images and then uses Math.ceiling to set aside to the right span of rows for the image.
